Dear xxx,

We plan to organize a summer school on graph signal processing in
Europe in 2017 or 2018 and would be delighted to welcome you as a
keynote speaker. The current proposition, waiting for approval, is to
held it at CIRM in Marseille, France, around April-June 2018. It is
organized by a group of PhD students from EPFL with a scientific
committee composed of Mauro Maggioni, Bruno Torr√©sani and myself. The
first edition (lts2.epfl.ch/summerschool
<http://lts2.epfl.ch/summerschool>) was held in 2015 in Switzerland.

The idea is for 5 keynote speakers to give 4 lessons of 45 minutes. In
exchange, you will be offered a single room and meals for the whole
week at CIRM (or a flat rate if you prefer to self-organize). Travel
costs will be defrayed, hopefully we'll be able to cover your full
expenses.

Depending on the funding opportunities and the interest of our
community, we may invite other peoples for shorter talks. The event
would then become a mix of a summer school (with keynote speakers) and
a workshop (with shorter talks).

Of course it's far away and the uncertainty is high, so we don't ask
you to confirm your attendance yet. If it's accepted and you are
interested, we'll come back to you in June (once we get a response
from the CIRM) to discuss further.

Best regards,
Pascal Frossard, on behalf of the scientific and organizing committees
