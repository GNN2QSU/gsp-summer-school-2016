Dear xxx,

We plan to organize a summer school on graph signal processing in Europe in 2017
or 2018 and would be delighted to welcome you as a keynote speaker. We are
submitting a first proposal for the Summer School to be held at CIRM in
Marseille, France, around April-June 2018. It is organized by a group of PhD
students from EPFL with a scientific committee composed of Mauro Maggioni, Bruno
Torr√©sani and myself. A first edition (lts2.epfl.ch/summerschool) was held in
2015 in Switzerland.

The tentative proposal is built on a program of lectures from 5 keynote
speakers, who would each give 4 lessons of 45 minutes. The keynote speakers
would be offered at least lodging at CIRM and support to cover the travel costs
(hopefully the full travel costs). Depending on the funding opportunities, we
may also invite other speakers for shorter talks.

We surely understand that you could not give a final response to our invitation,
as some uncertainty remains in particular about the precise timing of the Summer
School. Nevertheless, we would appreciate to know if you are a priori
interested. If this is the case, we will certainly get back to you with more
details as soon as we hear anything about our proposal.

Many thanks. Best regards,
Pascal Frossard, on behalf of the scientific and organising committees
