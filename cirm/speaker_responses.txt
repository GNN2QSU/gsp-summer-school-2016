Rémi Gribonval
	Merci pour l’invitation, a priori ça m’intéresse bien en effet !

Ulrike von Luxburg
	thanks for your invitation. It sounds tempting, but at the current time I do
	not want to commit. The main reason is that it is surprisingly complicated
	to travel from Tuebingen to the CIRM. If you choose a location in the alps
	likelihood would be much higher that I accept :-)

Jure Leskovec
	Thanks for reaching out and thanks for the invitation. As you say 2018 is
	very far away and it is impossible to say what the situation will be then.
	Time permitting I'd be happy to come and teach at the school. Let's keep in
	touch.

Daniel Spielman
	First, I thank you very much for the invitation. I am sorry to say that I am
	going to decline. I find that I don't enjoy going to isolated research
	institutes like CIRM, Oberwolfach, etc. But, if you wind up holding such a
	summer school inside a city, please think of me.
