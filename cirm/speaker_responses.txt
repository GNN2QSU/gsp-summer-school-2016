	Merci pour l’invitation, a priori ça m’intéresse bien en effet !

	thanks for your invitation. It sounds tempting, but at the current time I do
	not want to commit. The main reason is that it is surprisingly complicated
	to travel from Tuebingen to the CIRM. If you choose a location in the alps
	likelihood would be much higher that I accept :-)
